  abstract = {Oxygen reducing terminal oxidases differ with respect to their subunit composition, heme groups, operon structure, and affinity for O2. Six families of terminal oxidases are currently recognized, all of which occur in alphaproteobacterial genomes, two of which are also present in mitochondria. Many alphaproteobacteria encode several different terminal oxidases, likely reflecting ecological versatility with respect to oxygen levels. Terminal oxidase evolution likely started with the advent of O2 roughly 2.4 billion years ago and terminal oxidases diversified in the Proterozoic, during which oxygen levels remained low, around the Pasteur point (ca. 2 {$\mu$}M O2). Among the alphaproteobacterial genomes surveyed, those from members of the Rhodospirillaceae reveal the greatest diversity in oxygen reductases. Some harbor all six terminal oxidase types, in addition to many soluble enzymes typical of anaerobic fermentations in mitochondria and hydrogenosomes of eukaryotes. Recent data have it that O2 levels increased to current values (21\% v/v or ca. 250 {$\mu$}M) only about 430 million years ago. Ecological adaptation brought forth different lineages of alphaproteobacteria and different lineages of eukaryotes that have undergone evolutionary specialization to high oxygen, low oxygen, and anaerobic habitats. Some have remained facultative anaerobes that are able to generate ATP with or without the help of oxygen and represent physiological links to the ancient proteobacterial lineage at the origin of mitochondria and eukaryotes. Our analysis reveals that the genomes of alphaproteobacteria appear to retain signatures of ancient transitions in aerobic metabolism, findings that are relevant to mitochondrial evolution in eukaryotes as well.},

  abstract = {The Cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus account for a substantial fraction of marine primary production. Here, we present quantitative niche models for these lineages that assess present and future global abundances and distributions. These niche models are the result of neural network, nonparametric, and parametric analyses, and they rely on {$>$}35,000 discrete observations from all major ocean regions. The models assess cell abundance based on temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but the individual responses to these environmental variables differ for each lineage. The models estimate global biogeographic patterns and seasonal variability of cell abundance, with maxima in the warm oligotrophic gyres of the Indian and the western Pacific Oceans and minima at higher latitudes. The annual mean global abundances of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are 2.9 {\textpm} 0.1 {\texttimes} 1027 and 7.0 {\textpm} 0.3 {\texttimes} 1026 cells, respectively. Using projections of sea surface temperature as a result of increased concentration of greenhouse gases at the end of the 21st century, our niche models projected increases in cell numbers of 29\% and 14\% for Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, respectively. The changes are geographically uneven but include an increase in area. Thus, our global niche models suggest that oceanic microbial communities will experience complex changes as a result of projected future climate conditions. Because of the high abundances and contributions to primary production of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, these changes may have large impacts on ocean ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus marinus is present in all tropical and subtropical oceans, where it is often found throughout the euphotic zone, contributing significantly to phytoplankton biomass and primary production and growing at rates comparable to those of other picoplankters. Clearly, Prochlorococcus and eucaryotic picoplankton share significant niche dimensions in the open ocean. Here we report the discovery of populations of Prochlorococcus in layers below the oxyclines of the oxygen minimum zones of the Arabian Sea and the Eastern Tropical North Pacific off Mexico. The unusual aspects of these populations are that these were at times virtual monoalgal cultures found at a depth of 80 to 140m, often below the euphotic zone, where irradiance ranged from less than 0.1 to 2\% of the surface irradiance (I0). The pigment complement of these deep populations was characterized in detail. The previously unidentified Chl-c-like pigment of Prochlorococcus is Mg-3,8-divinylpheoporphyrin a5 monomethylester. The carotenoid complement of populations in these deep layers was similar to that of cultured Prochlorococcus strains, except for high concentrations of a 7{$\prime$},8{$\prime$}-dihydro-derivative of zeaxanthin, quite likely parasiloxanthin. Even though cellular concentrations of pigments were very high in these populations, suggesting acclimation to low irradiance, ambient light experienced by these populations in the Arabian Sea, {$<$}0.1\% I0, may not have been sufficient to support normal photoautotrophic growth. Off Mexico these deep Prochlorococcus populations were located at 0.2 and 2\% I0 isolumes, an irradiance likely sufficient for slow growth. Environmental conditions in these layers, except for concentrations of oxygen, are similar to those found at and below the subsurface chlorophyll maxima of the subtropical central gyres. As only Prochlorococcus thrives in these layers but Prochlorococcus and eucaryotic picoplankton coexist in and below subsurface chlorophyll maxima, we conclude that the low oxygen concentrations at the deep Prochlorococcus maxima are the determining factor, but we are not able to identify any specific physiological functions that are affected by low oxygen concentrations in eucaryotes but not Prochlorococcus.},

The stepwise assembly process is facilitated by numerous protein factors that have been identified in recent years. Further analysis of this process requires the development or refinement of specific methods for the identification of novel assembly factors and, in particular, elucidation of the unique role of each. Here we summarize current knowledge of PSII biogenesis in cyanobacteria, focusing primarily on the impact of methodological advances and innovations.

Here, we show that D5D/D6D provide a mechanism for glycolytic NAD+ recycling that permits ongoing glycolysis and cell viability when the cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio is reduced, analogous to lactate fermentation. Although lesser in magnitude than lactate production, this desaturase-mediated NAD+ recycling is acutely adaptive when aerobic respiration is impaired in vivo. Notably, inhibition of either HUFA synthesis or lactate fermentation increases the other, underscoring their interdependence. Consistent with this, a type 2 diabetes risk haplotype in SLC16A11 that reduces pyruvate transport (thus limiting lactate production) increases D5D/D6D activity in vitro and in humans, demonstrating a chronic effect of desaturase-mediated NAD+ recycling. These findings highlight key biologic roles for D5D/D6D activity independent of their HUFA end products and expand the current paradigm of glycolytic NAD+ regeneration.},

It enables the calculation of the steady-state turnover rates and enzyme-state populations as functions of the cytochrome c reduction state, oxygen concentration, membrane potential, and pH on either side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. We use the model to explain the enigmatic decrease in oxygen affinity of the enzyme that has been observed in mitochondria when the proton-motive force is increased. The importance of the 26 transitions in the mechanism of cytochrome oxidase for the functional properties of cytochrome oxidase is compared through Metabolic Control Analysis. The control of the KM value is distributed mainly between the steps in the mechanism that involve electrogenic proton movements, with both positive and negative contributions. Positive contributions derive from the same steps that control enzyme turnover rate in the model. Limitations and possible further applications of the model are discussed.},

This group consists of multiple ecotypes that are physiologically and phylogenetically distinct and occur in different abundances along environmental gradients. Here we examine adaptations to phosphate (P) limitation among ecotypes. First, we used DNA microarrays to identify genes involved in the P-starvation response in two strains belonging to different ecotypes, MED4 (high-light-adapted) and MIT9313 (low-light-adapted). Most of the up-regulated genes under P starvation were unique to one strain. In MIT9313, many ribosomal genes were down-regulated, suggesting a general stress response in this strain. We also observed major differences in regulation. The P-starvation-induced genes comprise two clusters on the chromosome, the first containing the P master regulator phoB and most known P-acquisition genes and the second, absent in MIT9313, containing genes of unknown function. We examined the organization of the phoB gene cluster in 11 Prochlorococcus strains belonging to diverse ecotypes and found high variability in gene content that was not congruent with rRNA phylogeny. We hypothesize that this genome variability is related to differences in P availability in the oceans from which the strains were isolated. Analysis of a metagenomic library from the Sargasso Sea supports this hypothesis; most Prochlorococcus cells in this low-P environment contain the P-acquisition genes seen in MED4, although a number of previously undescribed gene combinations were observed.}

The spectral values of light absorption, scattering and backscattering of intact cells in suspension were determined, together with cell counts, size distribution and pigment composition (via HPLC). The spectral efficiency factors Qa, Qb, Qbb for light absorption, scattering and backscattering respectively, were derived, as well as the corresponding chlorophyll-specific coefficients a*, b* and bb*. The pigment used when normalizing is ``true'' chlorophyll a for Synechococcus, and divinyl-chlorophyll a for Prochlorococcus. In correspondence with small sizes (0.6 {$\mu$}m, on average) Prochlorococcus exhibits Qb values below those of Synechococcus (size about 0.9 {$\mu$}m, on average). In contrast, Qa is higher for Prochlorococcus than for Synechococcus, in response to high internal divinyl-chlorophyll content. In the blue part of the spectrum the probability for photons of being absorbed by a Prochlorococcus cell exceeds that of being scattered. Such a combination has never been found before for other algal cells, consistently more efficient as scatterers than as absorbers. The magnitude of the three efficiency Q-factors, as well as their spectral variations, can be understood and reconstructed in the frame of the Mie theory. The impact of these small organisms, dominant in oligotrophic environment, upon the optical properties of such waters are discussed on the basis of their chlorophyll-specific optical coefficients. Their absorption capabilities (per unit of chlorophyll) are not far from being maximum, to the extent that the package effect is rather reduced. With respect to scattering, Prochlorococcus cells have a minute signature compared to that of Synechococcus. This point is illustrated using vertical profiles of fluorescence, attenuation coefficient, cell number, Chl a and divinyl-Chl a concentrations, as observed in an oligotrophic tropical situation. Even if the backscattering-to-scattering ratio is, as theoretically expected, higher for Prochlorococcus than for all other algae (including Synechococcus), their light backscattering capacity definitely remains negligible.},

  abstract = {The extrinsic PsbU and PsbV proteins are known to play a critical role in stabilizing the M\- n4CaO5 cluster of the PSII oxygenevolving complex (OEC). However, most isolates of the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus naturally miss these proteins, even though they have kept the main OEC protein, PsbO. A structural homology model of the PSII of such a natural deletion mutant strain (P. marinus MED4) did not reveal any obvious compensation mechanism for this lack. To assess the physiological consequences of this unusual OEC, we compared oxygen evolution between Prochlorococcus strains missing psbU and psbV (PCC 9511 and SS120) and two marine strains possessing these genes (Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313 and Synechococcus sp. WH7803). While the low light-adapted strain SS120 exhibited the lowest maximal \-O2 evolution rates \-(Pmax per divinyl-chlorophyll a, per cell or per photosystem II) of all four strains, the high light-adapted strain PCC 9511 displayed even higher \-PChlmax and P\- PSIImax at high irradiance than Synechococcus sp. WH7803. Furthermore, thermoluminescence glow curves did not show any alteration in the B-band shape or peak position that could be related to the lack of these extrinsic proteins. This suggests an efficient functional adaptation of the OEC in these natural deletion mutants, in which PsbO alone is seemingly sufficient to ensure proper oxygen evolution. Our study also showed that Prochlorococcus strains exhibit negative net O\- 2 evolution rates at the low irradiances encountered in minimum oxygen zones, possibly explaining the very low \-O2 concentrations measured in these environments, where Prochlorococcus is the dominant oxyphototroph.},

  abstract = {The Pasteur point is a level of oxygen (about 0.3\% by volume which is less than 1\% of Present Atmospheric Level or PAL) above which facultative aerobic microorganisms and facultative anaerobes adapt from fermentation to aerobic respiration. It is also used to mark the level of oxygen in the early atmosphere of the Earth that is believed to have led to major evolutionary changes. It is named after Louis Pasteur, the French microbiologist who studied anaerobic microbial fermentation, and is related to the Pasteur effect.It was once supposed that about 400 million years ago, in the Cambrian period, the level of oxygen in the atmosphere rose from 0.1 to 1 percent of present atmospheric level. Supposedly, this led to many organisms adapting from fermentation to respiration, leading to organisms evolving photosynthesis and what is termed the Cambrian explosion of species. It has also been suggested that this increased oxygen level reduced the influence of ultraviolet radiation.It is now well documented that oxygen level reached at least 10\% of the present value 2.4 billion years ago (for details see Great Oxygenation Event).},

  abstract = {Microalgae and cyanobacteria are considered as important model organisms to investigate the biology of photosynthesis; moreover, they are valuable sources of biomolecules for several biotechnological applications. Understanding the species-specific traits of photosynthetic electron transport is extremely important, because it contributes to the regulation of ATP/NADPH ratio, which has direct/indirect links to carbon fixation and other metabolic pathways and thus overall growth and biomass production. In the present work, a cuvette-based setup is developed, in which a combination of measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll fluorescence and NADPH kinetics can be performed without disturbing the physiological status of the sample. The suitability of the system is demonstrated using a model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, as well as biofuel-candidate microalgae species, such as Chlorella sorokiniana, Dunaliella salina and Nannochloropsis limnetica undergoing inorganic carbon (Ci) limitation. Inorganic carbon limitation, induced by photosynthetic Ci uptake under continuous illumination, caused a decrease in the effective quantum yield of PSII (Y(II)) and loss of oxygen-evolving capacity in all species investigated here; these effects were largely recovered by the addition of NaHCO3. Detailed analysis of the dark-light and light-dark transitions of NADPH production/uptake and changes in chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics revealed species- and condition-specific responses. These responses indicate that the impact of decreased Calvin-Benson cycle activity on photosynthetic electron transport pathways involving several sections of the electron transport chain (such as electron transfer via the QA-QB-plastoquinone pool, the redox state of the plastoquinone pool) can be analyzed with high sensitivity in a comparative manner. Therefore, the integrated system presented here can be applied for screening for specific traits in several significant species at different stages of inorganic carbon limitation, a condition that strongly impacts primary productivity.},

It numerically dominates the phytoplankton in the tropical and subtropical oceans2,3, and is responsible for a significant fraction of global photosynthesis. Here we compare the genomes of two Prochlorococcus strains that span the largest evolutionary distance within the Prochlorococcus lineage4 and that have different minimum, maximum and optimal light intensities for growth5. The high-light-adapted ecotype has the smallest genome (1,657,990 base pairs, 1,716 genes) of any known oxygenic phototroph, whereas the genome of its low-light-adapted counterpart is significantly larger, at 2,410,873 base pairs (2,275 genes). The comparative architectures of these two strains reveal dynamic genomes that are constantly changing in response to myriad selection pressures. Although the two strains have 1,350 genes in common, a significant number are not shared, and these have been differentially retained from the common ancestor, or acquired through duplication or lateral transfer. Some of these genes have obvious roles in determining the relative fitness of the ecotypes in response to key environmental variables, and hence in regulating their distribution and abundance in the oceans.},

The stoichiometry of 3ATP/2NADPH = 12H+/4e- is the absolute requirement for CO2 reduction. For a half of a century it has been a common belief that violations of this stoichiometry are corrected by cyclic electron transport (CET) during which some electrons are cycling around photosystem I (PSI) in an H+ coupled way. Though CET was detected in plant leaves, its rate was never exactly quantified, as well the amount of CET-related ATP synthesis was not compared with the actual ATP needs. In this work CET rate was measured and the assumed ATP synthesis quantified in leaves under experimental conditions where the metabolic ATP consumption was reduced to minimum. Differently from the present common belief, CET rate is at maximum when ATP is at maximum and its additional synthesis is unnecessary. The conclusion is that CET is variably coupled with transmembrane H+ translocation. Therefore the new model of CET is developed to explain this situation.},

  abstract = {Marine picocyanobacteria of the genus Prochlorococcus are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in the modern ocean, where they exert a profound influence on elemental cycling and energy flow. The use of transmembrane chlorophyll complexes instead of phycobilisomes as light-harvesting antennae is considered a defining attribute of Prochlorococcus. Its ecology and evolution are understood in terms of light, temperature, and nutrients. Here, we report single-cell genomic information on previously uncharacterized phylogenetic lineages of this genus from nutrient-rich anoxic waters of the eastern tropical North and South Pacific Ocean. The most basal lineages exhibit optical and genotypic properties of phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria, indicating that the characteristic light-harvesting antenna of the group is not an ancestral attribute. Additionally, we found that all the indigenous lineages analyzed encode genes for pigment biosynthesis under oxygen-limited conditions, a trait shared with other freshwater and coastal marine cyanobacteria. Our findings thus suggest that Prochlorococcus diverged from other cyanobacteria under low-oxygen conditions before transitioning from phycobilisomes to transmembrane chlorophyll complexes and may have contributed to the oxidation of the ancient ocean.},

  abstract = {A simple method for whole-cell hybridization using fluorescently labeled rRNA-targeted peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes was developed for use in marine cyanobacterial picoplankton. In contrast to established protocols, this method is capable of detecting rRNA in Prochlorococcus, the most abundant unicellular marine cyanobacterium. Because the method avoids the use of alcohol fixation, the chlorophyll content of Prochlorococcus cells is preserved, facilitating the identification of these cells in natural samples. PNA probe-conferred fluorescence was measured flow cytometrically and was always significantly higher than that of the negative control probe, with positive/negative ratio varying between 4 and 10, depending on strain and culture growth conditions. Prochlorococcus cells from open ocean samples were detectable with this method. RNase treatment reduced probe-conferred fluorescence to background levels, demonstrating that this signal was in fact related to the presence of rRNA. In another marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus, in which both PNA and oligonucleotide probes can be used in whole-cell hybridizations, the magnitude of fluorescence from the former was fivefold higher than that from the latter, although the positive/negative ratio was comparable for both probes. In Synechococcus cells growing at a range of growth rates (and thus having different rRNA concentrations per cell), the PNA- and oligonucleotide-derived signals were highly correlated (r = 0.99). The chemical nature of PNA, the sensitivity of PNA-RNA binding to single-base-pair mismatches, and the preservation of cellular integrity by this method suggest that it may be useful for phylogenetic probing of whole cells in the natural environment.},

Materials and methods Mitochondrial respiration was compared in situ in saponin-skinned fibers isolated from the soleus muscles of Wistar rats, in solution enriched in O2 by injection or the electrolytic process 1) at an O2 concentration decreasing from 240 {\textmu}mol/L to 10 {\textmu}mol/L (132 mmHg to 5 mmHg), with glutamate--malate or N, N, N{$\prime$}, N{$\prime$}-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD)--ascorbate (with antimycin A) as substrates; and 2) at increasing adenosine diphosphate (ADP) concentration with glutamate--malate as substrate. Results As expected, maximal respiration decreased with O2 concentration and, when compared to glutamate--malate, the apparent Km O2 of mitochondria for O2 was significantly lower with TMPD--ascorbate with both waters. However, when compared to the water enriched in O2 by injection, the Km O2 was significantly lower with both electron donors in water enriched in O2 by electrolysis. This was not associated with any increase in the sensitivity of mitochondria to ADP; no significant difference was observed for the Km ADP between the two waters. Conclusion In this experiment, a higher affinity of the mitochondria for O2 was observed in water enriched in O2 by electrolysis than by injection. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that O2 diffusion can be facilitated in water enriched in O2 by the electrolytic process.},
