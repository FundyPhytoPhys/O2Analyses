# Introduction
Photosynthesis is the fundamental process in the biosphere. [@patilMultiparametricScreeningPlatform2020]
*Prochlorococcus*:
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
- Photosynthetic unicellular cyanobacterium 
- Important in global carbon cycling, *Prochlorococcus* contributes significantly to primary production in the open oceans. 
- Strains occupy a wide range of habitats.
- With climate change, ocean warming causing a decrease of oxygen solubility at the surface, *Prochlorococcus* is expected to benefit, increasing its distribution and global abundance.

```

## Objectives

1. Determine whether *Prochlorococcus* strains are constitutively able to accomodate changes in oxygen, or whether they acclimate over a period of time to different levels of oxygen.
2. To provide insights into the potential ecological niches of *Prochlorococcus* strains.

# Methods

**Bioptical Analysis of Growth Rates**
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
Using a Multi-Cultivator, three strains of Prochlorococcus (MED4, MIT9313, SS120) are monitored for OD680 (Chlorophyll and scattering) under a 12h photoperiod and blue light (450 ± 45 nm). Combinations of:
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
- Dissolved O~2~
  - 230-280 µM (full O~2~)
  - 25-50 µM (intermediate O~2~)
  - 0.5-5.0 µM (low O~2~) 
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
- Light level 
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
  - 30 µmol photons m-2 s-1
  - 90 µmol photons m-2 s-1
  - 180 µmol photons m-2 s-1
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
all at 22°C, to each of 8 separate tubes.

**Bioptical Functional Measurements**
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
- Expose samples to a series of increasing light levels and track a 'light response' curve of photosynthetic function of Photosystem II, using Solisense FRRf  Instrument.
- Photosystem I and Photosystem II in parallel, using Dual-PAM-100 Instrument. The oxygen levels tested included:
  - 230-280 µM (full O~2~)
  - 25-50 µM (intermediate O~2~) 
  - 0.5-5.0 µM (low O~2~)

```
- Strain MED4 shows consistent Pmax values across different oxygen concentrations, indicating constitutive adaptation to varying oxygen levels.
- Strain MIT9313 shows differences in Pmax values, particularly between the lowest (2 µM) and highest (250 µM) oxygen concentrations, indicating acclimating adaptation to varying oxygen levels.
- These findings underscore the influence of oxygen concentrations on the PSII electron transport capacity of *Prochlorococcus* strains, with significant changes in Pmax values suggesting the cells' capability to acclimate to different oxygen concentrations over time.

# Next Steps

- Cell pellets were obtained by centrifuging samples, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and preserved in an -80°C freezer, facilitating future transcriptomic analyses.
- Whole Cell Absorbance Spectra were measured using an Olis Spectrophotometer, with oxygen levels tested ranging from 230-280 µM (full O2) to 0.5-5.0 µM (low O2), providing comprehensive data on cellular responses to varying oxygen concentrations.
- Chlorophyll a concentrations were determined for each sample using either the Turner Trilogy or Spectrophotometer, aiding in the characterization of photosynthetic pigment content and its relation to oxygen levels.
