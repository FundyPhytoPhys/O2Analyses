# Introduction
Photosynthesis is the fundamental process in the biosphere. [@patilMultiparametricScreeningPlatform2020]
*Prochlorococcus*:
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
- Photosynthetic unicellular cyanobacterium 
- Important in global carbon cycling, *Prochlorococcus* contributes significantly to primary production in the open oceans. 
- Strains occupy a wide range of habitats.
- With climate change, ocean warming causing a decrease of oxygen solubility at the surface, *Prochlorococcus* is expected to benefit, increasing its distribution and global abundance.

```

## Objectives

1. Determine whether *Prochlorococcus* strains are constitutively able to accomodate changes in oxygen, or whether they acclimate over a period of time to different levels of oxygen.
2. To provide insights into the potential ecological niches of *Prochlorococcus* strains.

# Methods

**Bioptical Analysis of Growth Rates**
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
Using a Multi-Cultivator, two strains of Prochlorococcus (MED4, MIT9313) are monitored for OD680 (Chlorophyll and scattering) and OD720 (cell scattering).
under a 12h photoperiod and blue light (450 ± 45 nm). Combinations of:
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
- Dissolved O~2~
  - 230-280 µM (full O~2~)
  - 25-50 µM (intermediate O~2~)
  - 0.5-5.0 µM (low O~2~) 
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
- Light level 
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
  - 30, 90, 180 µmol photons m-2 s-1
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
all at 22°C, to each of 8 separate tubes.

**Bioptical Functional Measurements**
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
- Expose samples to a series of increasing light levels and track a 'light response' curve of photosynthetic function of Photosystem II, using Solisense FRRf  Instrument.
- Photosystem I and Photosystem II in parallel, using Dual-PAM-100 Instrument. The oxygen levels tested included:
  - 230-280 µM (full O~2~)
  - 25-50 µM (intermediate O~2~) 
  - 0.5-5.0 µM (low O~2~) 
  
# Results & Discussion

```{r EstimatePmax, fig.cap= 'Analysis of Maximum PSII Electron Transport Rate (Pmax) for *Prochlorococcus* MED4 (Clade HLI) and MIT9313 (Clade LLIV). Pmax,  derived from light response curve fits (FIGURE)), is plotted vs. measurement oxygen concentrations, with error bars representing the standard error of the estimate.

```
- Strain MED4 shows consistent Pmax values across different oxygen concentrations, indicating constitutive adaptation to varying oxygen levels.
- Strain MIT9313 shows differences in Pmax values, particularly between the lowest (2 µM) and highest (250 µM) oxygen concentrations, indicating acclimating adaptation to varying oxygen levels.
- These findings underscore the influence of oxygen concentrations on the PSII electron transport capacity of *Prochlorococcus* strains, with significant changes in Pmax values suggesting the cells' capability to acclimate to different oxygen concentrations over time.

# Next Steps

- Cell pellets were obtained by centrifuging samples, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and preserved in an -80°C freezer, facilitating future transcriptomic analyses.
- Whole Cell Absorbance Spectra were measured using an Olis Spectrophotometer, with oxygen levels tested ranging from 230-280 µM (full O2) to 0.5-5.0 µM (low O2), providing comprehensive data on cellular responses to varying oxygen concentrations.
- Chlorophyll a concentrations were determined for each sample using either the Turner Trilogy or Spectrophotometer, aiding in the characterization of photosynthetic pigment content and its relation to oxygen levels.
