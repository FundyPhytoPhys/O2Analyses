# Introduction
Photosynthesis is the fundamental process in the biosphere. 
*Prochlorococcus*:
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
- Photosynthetic unicellular cyanobacterium 
- Important in global carbon cycling, *Prochlorococcus* contributes significantly to primary production in the open oceans. 
- Strains occupy a wide range of habitats.
- With climate change, ocean warming causing a decrease of oxygen solubility at the surface, *Prochlorococcus* is expected to benefit, increasing its distribution and global abundance.

We use:
<p class="forceBreak"></p>
- Bioptical measures of growth and photosynthesis

## Objectives

1. Determine whether *Prochlorococcus* strains are constitutively able to accomodate changes in oxygen, or whether they acclimate over a period of time to different levels of oxygen.

```

Across both strains, a trend is observed, indicating that Pmax values exhibit variation corresponding to changes in oxygen concentration. Specifically, strain MED4 demonstrates relatively consistent Pmax values across different oxygen concentrations, although with minor fluctuations. Since Pmax remains reletively stable across varying oxygen concentrations, this suggests that the cells are constitutively adapted to cope with changes in oxygen levels.

However, strain MIT9313 exhibits more pronounced differences in Pmax values, particularly evident between the lowest (2 µM) and highest (250 µM) oxygen levels. These findings underscore the strain-specific responses of *Prochlorococcus* to varying oxygen concentrations, suggesting a significant influence of oxygen levels on the PSII electron transport capacity of these strains. Since Pmax valuex show significant changes in the response to a change in oxygen concentrations, it suggests that the cells are capable of acclimating to different oxygen concentrations over time.

# Next Steps

In addition to the experiments conducted so far, transcriptomic analyses could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying different *Prochlorococcus* strains responses to varying oxygen concentrations. By examining changes in gene expression patterns, particularly those associated with oxygen metabolism and photosynthesis regulation, researchers can identify key genes and pathways involved in the cellular response to different oxygen levels. Transcriptomic analyses would allow for a comprehensive understanding of how different *Prochlorococcus* strains modulates there gene expression profile to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions, providing a deeper understanding into the cellular strategies employed by different *Prochlorococcus* strains to thrive in diverse marine ecosystems.
